Greenbaum's master classes are unique as flutists learn to bridge the gap between folk and classical as well as learning a new genre.Being a pioneer in reviving the art of klezmer flute performance has garnered invitations to be guest artist for many flute organizations in the US, in the UK, and, most recently, in France. In addition, her performances on the simple system flute offer a special look into historic performance practices of both classical and klezmer of the 19th century.
