A 40-voice women's choir based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, The Aeolian Singers have enjoyed close to 30 years of music making. The choir has toured Europe twice, recorded radio and television programs, and performed many times as guest artists of Symphony Nova Scotia. The Aeolians' repertoire spans five centuries and a wide variety of styles, with a primary focus on music composed specifically for women's voices. The choir has commissioned many works by well-known Atlantic Canadian composers, including Scott Macmillan, Gary Ewer, Alisdair MacLean, Donna Rhodenizer, Laura Hoffman, Dennis Farrell and Lydia Adams. Much of the Aeolians' repertoire features other Canadian composers as well.
