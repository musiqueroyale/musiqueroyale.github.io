Alison lives in Glasgow and plays and teaches baroque cello and viola da gamba (aka viol). In order to study Early Music, Alison lived in London and worked there for many years as a principal cellist and soloist with many of the leading Early Music groups. Her main musical partnerships now are with Brecon Baroque and the violinist Rachel Podger, and Glasgow's Concerto Caledonia and David McGuinness. She's a guest director of projects with baroque orchestras in Poland and Austria. As a teacher, she has links with many of the British music colleges, and also teaches intensive courses in Lodz, Poland and Wales. In other capacities, she runs Katherine McGillivray's 'Get a Life Fund', a charity which funds sabbaticals for musicians, and has trained as a Feldenkrais MethodÂ® practitioner to explore how the way we move can influence the music we make.
