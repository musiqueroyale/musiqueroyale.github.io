Capella Regalis Men and Boys Choir was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by Director Nick Halley in 2010. The choir comprises ten men and twelve boys (ages 7–14) and is modeled on the great Anglican tradition of men and boys church choirs. While Canada was once rich with such choirs, Capella Regalis is one of only a handful of men and boys choirs in Canada today.

The choir sings Choral Evensong every Tuesday of the academic term at 5:00 p.m. in the University of King's College Chapel, 6350 Coburg Road, Halifax. The choir also performs concerts throughout Nova Scotia and beyond in a busy September – July season. Past concerts range from Bach's St. Matthew Passion with the King's College Chapel Choir to Carmina Burana with the Nova Scotia Youth Orchestra and King's Chorus to the ever-popular annual Christmas concert, To Bethlehem with Kings. In addition to services and concerts, the boys of Capella Regalis enjoy a summer choir camp in the last week of August and other musically- and socially-enriching outings and experiences. The choir is a free programme open to any boy who passes an audition.
