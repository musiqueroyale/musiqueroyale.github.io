Hailed by The New Yorker as “a flute player of spectacular and imaginative virtuosity”, Chris Norman's brilliant and warm-toned flute playing has contributed to groups as diverse as The Baltimore Consort, Skyedance, Helicon, Chatham Baroque, and Concerto Caledonia. His influential work for the past 30 years as performer, composer, recording artist, educator, and director of the Boxwood Festival & Workshop has played a significant role in reviving the flute in traditional Scottish and Canadian music. His playing has appeared on more than 40 award winning recordings, and can be heard featured on the Oscar winning soundtrack of Titanic and other Hollywood films including, Soldier, and Stone of Destiny. Norman also brings a wealth of technical knowledge in the craftsmanship of wooden flute making.
