Coastal Voices Men's Choir came into existence in 2011 to support and promote male choral singing on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia. As the men gained choral skills, the group became a permanent performing vocal ensemble. A name was chosen and the choir debuted at the Memory Lane Heritage Village in Lake Charlotte in the summer of 2012. In the 2014
season the choir premiered the song “Come with Me” composed by choir member and songwriter Jim Reid. Gary Ewer, well-known educator, conductor and composer arranged the work for the choir. The “Come with Me” project was supported by a grant from the Nova Scotia Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage. The 17 member choir has a six month season from January to June.

The choir is under the leadership of Music Director Janet Gaskin and accompanist John Plant.
