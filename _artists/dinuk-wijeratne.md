The Sri Lankan-born Dinuk Wijeratne is a JUNO, ECMA, and SOCAN award winning composer who has been described by the New York Times as ‘exuberantly creative' and by the Toronto Star as ‘an artist who reflects a positive vision of our cultural future'. Active also as a conductor and pianist, Dinuk's boundary-crossing work sees him equally at home in collaborations with symphony orchestras and string quartets, Tabla players and DJs, and takes him to international venues as poles apart as the Berlin Philharmonie and the North Sea Jazz Festival. Dinuk has also appeared at the Lincoln Center, Kennedy Center, Opera Bastille, Teatro Colón, and across Sri Lanka, Japan, the UK, and the Middle East. Season highlights include Dinuk's appointment as Composer-in-Residence of Symphony Nova Scotia, and his role in *'What would Beethoven do?'* - the recent documentary about innovation in Classical music featuring Eric Whitacre, Bobby McFerrin and Ben Zander. Dinuk grew up in Dubai and took up initial composition studies at the Royal Northern College of Music (UK), later studying with Oscar-winning composer John Corigliano at the Juilliard School. His music and collaborative work embrace the great diversity of his international background and influences.
