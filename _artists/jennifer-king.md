Energetic and insightful, Jennifer King is a versatile pianist who is equally at home on the concert stage, and in the classroom. Also in high demand as an adjudicator, coach, and clinician, she has firmly established herself as a sought-after talent across Atlantic Canada.

A faculty pianist at Acadia University's School of Music since 2003, Ms. King has performed in hundreds of recitals and concerts at the respected institution as a collaborative pianist, and as a solo artist. Outside the walls of academia, Jennifer has been heard in concert alongside some of Canada's leading singers such as Measha Bruggergosman, Richard Margison, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and Mary Lou Fallis. She can also be heard on CBC Radio, and seen on a variety of television programs, including the hit Bathroom Divas on Bravo.

Jennifer is a strong believer in community, and in reaching out to the next generation of artists, and educators. She was the founder, and an executive council member of the Prince Edward Island Registered Music Teachers' Association, and she is currently the Vice-President and Registrar of the Nova Scotia Registered Music Teachers' Association. Other volunteer activities include sitting on concert committees, fundraising teams, and creating performance and education opportunities for emerging artists.

Ms. King holds a Masters of Music degree in solo piano performance from McGill University, and has completed postgraduate diplomas at the University of Reading in the UK as well as the prestigious Royal Academy of Music in London England. Other highlights from her musical background and education include a scholarship to the Kneisal Hall Chamber Music School, and a grant for contemporary music studies from the Britten Pears School for Advanced Musical Studies.

Her accolades include two scholarships from the Nova Scotia Talent Trust, various Alumni awards and a full entrance scholarship to Acadia University, and an Award of Appreciation from the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in recognition of her contributions to musical life in the province.

Outside of her multi-faceted career, Jennifer enjoys activities such as cycling, skiing, and boogie boarding. She also loves spending quality time with her husband, a veterinarian, and their two children, Maddie and Evan.
