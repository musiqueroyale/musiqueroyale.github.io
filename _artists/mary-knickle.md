Mary Knickle (Singer, actor, composer) has performed on stage in folk venues, theatres and folk festivals across Canada. Recently she has found a new passion in composing large works. Her Opera Morgan Le Fay received a rave review in Opera Canada Magasine, and her Seafarers' Requiem received national coverage on CBC radio. She is currently working on a new Opera and several choral works. She is thrilled to be singing one of her favourite styles, celtic music with Cynthia and Stacy.
