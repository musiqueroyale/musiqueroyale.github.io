Described by the CBC as the "hottest" guitar ensemble in Canada, MG3 has quickly established itself as a force to be reckoned with, as well as an interactive force in various musical forms. For over 15 years, the trio's virtuosity, rigour, creativity and impressive stage presence – where humour and interacting with the public go hand in hand – have been winning over audiences around the world. The trio, composed of guitarists Marc Morin, Sébastien Dufour and Glenn Lévesque, has given hundreds of concerts in some of the most prestigious venues across North America, Europe, New Zealand and Australia, including the BB King Blues Club in New York, the Rundetårnet in Copenhagen, and the legendary Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.

Throughout the years, the trio has collaborated and shared the stage with world-renowned ensembles and artists, such as the Orchestre symphonique de Québec, Jorane et Solorazaf. Their most memorable collaboration to date was, without a doubt, with the California Guitar Trio (CGT), when both ensembles joined forces to give an unforgettable concert, brilliantly performing some of the greatest rock classics from Queen, The Beatles, a few "spaghetti western" themes by Ennio Morricone, as well as some of their original compositions. Starting in the fall of 2010, the sextet has toured across Canada and the United States, performing in over 100 cities.

Winner of the 2011 Opus Award for "concert of the year" in the Jazz / World Music category, MG3 has released six albums. Der Prinz, under the Analekta label, has been launched in February 2014, during the 15th edition of the MONTRÉAL EN LUMIÈRE Festival.

What the media says...

"The Montreal Trio's guitars know no limits. They journey along with brio from jazz to classical music, from India to Canada. The Ussac Church has been swept away on the thunder of their strings!"

- La Montagne Newspaper - France

"... They delivered loads of infectious good humour and some solid ensemble playing that skirted the four corners of the musical world."

- Bill Rankin, Edmonton Journal – Canada

"... Their debut in Germany was one of the most unforgettable events in the festival's history, both artistically and programme-wise. [...] The audience applauded and didn't quieten down until the event organiser had promised to engage the Montreal Guitar Trio again next year..."
