THREE is an innovative chamber group born through the collaboration of renowned soloists and good friends Guy Few, Nadina Mackie-Jackson and Leslie Newman. With a combined mastery of flute, trumpet, corno, bassoon, and piano, THREE's programming is versatile and eclectic, ranging from the masterpieces of Western Europe to Argentinean tangos to newly commissioned works by Canada's own great composers. The Huntsville Forester quotes: "THREE's eclectic concertâ€¦was breathtaking. Whether playing superbly in solo pieces or performing with amazing synchronism as a trio,...left the audience totally enraptured after such a brilliant and exquisite musical evening." "(THREE) absolutely mesmerised the audience. Thanks to all of you for a wonderful evening." says Michael Rosen; Vice-President, Performing Arts Lakefield.
