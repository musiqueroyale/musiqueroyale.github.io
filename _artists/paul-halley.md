Paul Halley was born in England in 1952 and sang in the choir of St. Matthew's Church, Ottawa, when his family immigrated there. At age 16 he became an Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Toronto and won an organ scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. While organist and choirmaster at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1977 to 1989, he collaborated with Paul Winter to create the Missa gaia/earth mass, Halley became a member of the Paul Winter Consort, and earned five Grammy Awards for his contributions as a composer and performer with the group. He left the Consort in 1999 after recording Journey with the Sun to pursue a solo career. Paul Halley's compositions have been performed and recorded by the New Jersey Symphony and John Williams and the Boston Pops Orchestra.
