Composition. Piano. Broadcasting

Peter-Anthony's music is spiritually rooted and contemplative, ranging from the ethereally quiet to the explosive outer limits of contemplation. One of Canada's busiest contemporary composers, Juno nominated Togni has toured internationally and his music is regularly broadcast worldwide. Togni's works have been released on XXI Records, CBC Records, Hänssler Classics, Warner Classics UK and ECM.  He is also a well-known Canadian broadcaster. Recent recordings include *Lamentatio Jeremiah Prophetae*, (bass clarinettist Jeff Reilly and the Elmer Iseler Singers – 2010), *Spatium* (Togni Trio – 2012), *Piano Alone* (solo piano – 2013) and *Estuary* (Santuary Trio – 2015, ECMA nomination 2016). *Responsio* (premiered 2013) won the 2014 Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia Masterworks Arts Award, was released on ATMA classique (2015) and was nominated for a Juno Award (2016).  Warrior Songs, for percussionist Jerry Granelli and choir, premiered in Boulder Colorado (2014), with its Canadian premiere in Toronto (2015). Peter-Anthony played at the 53rd Magadino International Organ Festival (Switzerland – 2015), co-founded by his father the late Victor Togni. Isis and Osiris, Gods of Egypt, a new Canadian opera, will be part of Opera in Concert's 2016 season. Originally from Pembroke, Ontario, he currently resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he composes and teaches at Acadia and Dalhousie Universities.
