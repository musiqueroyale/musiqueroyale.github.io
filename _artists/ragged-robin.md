**Erin Dempsey** has been immersed in Irish Traditional music since childhood when she learned Tin Whistle from her father. She was also trained in Irish Traditional dancing, traveling across Canada competing in dance, whistle and Irish song. She began playing wooden flute after her first trip to Ireland in 2003, and now plays flutes constructed by her father, Sean Dempsey. In 2009 she moved to Ireland to refine her flute playing skills. She attended and hosted musical sessions across Ireland, studying with celebrated local performers in Cork, where she lived for four years. Her “piping style” flute playing is reminiscent of the traditional flute and fiddle players of Counties Clare, Galway, and Roscommon.

**Ellen Gibling** is a classically-trained harpist with a bachelor's degree in Harp Performance from McGill University. She is the harp instructor at Acadia University and has performed with Symphony Nova Scotia and the National Youth Orchestra of Canada. She is a also member of the pop band The Heavy Blinkers, and has performed and recorded with Jenn Grant. Irish music has been very important to Ellen since her first lessons on the harp, and she has continued to seek it out alongside her work in the classical and pop worlds. Ellen's interest in Irish music has led her to sessions and festivals in Quebec, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Ireland, as well as at home in Nova Scotia.
