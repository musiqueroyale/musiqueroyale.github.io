Rebecca Caine is equally comfortable singing musical theatre, opera, oratorio, and cabaret. Although born in Toronto, Ms Caine has divided her musical career between the UK and Canada when she is not performing as invited artist elsewhere. She created the role of Cosette in Les Miserables and was part of the original cast for Phantom of the Opera in BOTH London and Toronto. She has been the principal soprano in numerous operas throughout the world, is frequently heard in the UK on Radio 3, and recently performed in The Mikado (Katisha) at the Charing Cross Theatre to rave reviews.
