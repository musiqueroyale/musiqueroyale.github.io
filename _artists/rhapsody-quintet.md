Through their performances and recordings they have reached out across Canada and the world, performed for royalty, worked with school children and helped to raise funds for many deserving causes. Rhapsody has released six CDs to date. The members of Rhapsody Quintet are: Dominic Desautels, clarinet; Jennifer Jones, violin; David Langstroth, bass; Diana Torbert, piano and Shimon Walt, cello; all important members of Nova Scotia's professional musical scene.
