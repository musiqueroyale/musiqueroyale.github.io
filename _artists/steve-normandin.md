Fans of Steve Normandin know to expect riveting renditions of traditional chansons from France and Qu√©bec, enlivened by touches of jazz and swing and performed with a uniquely theatrical flair. Audiences discovering Normadin for the first time will find themselves in the hands of a true master: an artist who can make you laugh, cry, and dance in the space of one set of music. Equally accomplished as an instrumentalist and as a songwriter, Normandin has appeared as a soloist with the Quebec Symphony Orchestra, and toured internationally with a host of musical projects and theatrical productions.
