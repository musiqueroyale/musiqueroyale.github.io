Born in Acadia, Suzie LeBlanc fell in love with the Baroque early in life. Now an international star, the charismatic soprano provides convincing evidence for the popularity of Early Music while exploring French mélodies, lieder, Acadian folk music, contemporary music and, with Ensemble Mélosphère, the art of improvisation.

Recently appointed to the Order of Canada for her contribution to Acadian culture and to the performance of Early Music, she has also earned four honorary doctorates and a career grant from the Conseil des Arts du Québec.

Suzie's recordings have recieved several prestigious awards, including a Grammy award for a recording of Lully's Thésée with the Boston Early Music Festival, an Opus awards for best world music recording - "Tempi con Variazioni” - and best contemporary album, for a disc of early songs by Olivier Messiaen. In 2014, she was awarded ECMA's Best Classical Album (2014) for “I am in need of music”, which was also a finalist for the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia Masterworks Award.

2015 is a busy year for Suzie, including the songs on poems by Elizabeth Bishop from her CD “I am in need of Music” with the Victoria, P.E.I. and New-Brunswick symphony orchestras, Mozart arias with Symphony New-Brunswick, a duet concert with Emma Kirkby and Les Idées Heureuses and multiple appearances at the Montreal Baroque Festival. She also teaches at the Orford Arts Centre Academy in June and at the Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance (LAMP) in the fall.

Suzie is the founder and artistic director of Montreal's Le Nouvel Opéra and the honorary patron of the Elizabeth Bishop Society of Nova Scotia.
