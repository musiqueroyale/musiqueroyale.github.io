Symphony Nova Scotia is truly Nova Scotia's orchestra. With a home base in Halifax and performances across the province, Symphony Nova Scotia reaches more than 50,000 Nova Scotians of all ages each year with some of the most innovative concerts and educational offerings in the country.

Today, under the thoughtful and dynamic leadership of Music Director Bernhard Gueller, it is the largest employer in Nova Scotia's cultural community, employing 37 musicians and ten administrative staff, along with over 150 contracted artistic, production and technical personnel. Its talented team has won many awards, including four East Coast Music Awards for classical music.
