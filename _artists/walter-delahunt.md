Pianist Walter Delahunt is a native Nova Scotian and an artist of broad and distinguished experience. His career has taken him throughout Europe, the Middle East, North America and Asia. His musicianship is characterized by tremendous technical command of the instrument, unique sound quality, ease in chamber music, solo playing and accompanying and by a power of communication which immediately involves the listener.

He was professor at the Vienna Academy of Music between 1984 and 1997 and has recorded for Panton (Prague) and BMG Japan.
