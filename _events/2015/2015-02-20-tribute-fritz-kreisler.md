Musique Royale is pleased to present Tribute to Fritz Kreisler with Ewald Cheung , violin and Philip Chiu , piano. An evening meal will be served prior to the performance at 7:30 pm.

Fritz Kreisler was one of the greatest violinists of the twentieth century – an artist of great versatility, breathtaking virtuosity and charisma. Jeunesses Musicales has paired two vibrant, young Canadian talents in a performance that highlights the musical genius of Kreisler as both performer and composer.

Ewald Cheung has performed as soloist with numerous orchestras around Canada, with many distinguished conductors, including James Sommerville, Yoav Talmi, Victor Sawa, and William Eddins. He has also performed in recital series in Trois‐Rivieres, CAMMAC, and Edmonton with pianists such as Philip Chiu, Henry Mokken, and Michael Massey. As a chamber musician, Ewald was a founding member of Geistrio, which has performed at the Toronto Summer Music Festival in the summer of 2011 and at the Canadian Opera Company's Free Concert Series in May 2012\. He was also a founding member of the Roddick String Quartet, which has performed at the Toronto Summer Music Festival in 2008 and at the Montreal String Quartet in 2009, among many others. Ewald is currently records with the Espace 21 label (formerly XXI‐21 Productions). His first recording has been released in the spring of 2013.

An exceedingly sociable pianist, Philip Chiu consistently demonstrates his comfort as a soloist and collaborative pianist, having been widely acclaimed for the brilliance and sensitivity of his playing, as well as for his ability to connect with audiences. This past year included recitals with Radovan Vlatkovic, Regis Pasquier, Matt Haimovitz, and Ian Swensen. He recently recorded a disc of Schubert duos with TSO concertmaster Jonathan Crow (XXI‐21 Productions). A solo Liszt recording is also planned this season, with XXI‐21 Productions as well.
