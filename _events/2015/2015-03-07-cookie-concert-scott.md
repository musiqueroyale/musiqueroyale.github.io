Cookie concerts - combining originality, fun and engaging musical and artistic presentations - are designed for the whole family to enjoy. Our three guest musicians will draw upon Dixie Land favourites along with Celtic tunes on the banjo, some jazz standards on the trumpet and John Chiasson has a vast list of vocal tunes to add to the entertainment. Scott, John and John have collaborated in many kinds of settings and enjoy making music together.
