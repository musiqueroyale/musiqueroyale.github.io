You will get to hear a group of men and boys (ages 7 – 13) from Capella Regalis perform choral works spanning the centuries, and director Nick Halley will talk about each piece in a way that's sure to engage young and old alike. There will be lots of time for questions from the audience. This is a lovely way to get a close-up look at one of the province's unique music training groups.

Cecilia's Retreat (performance is followed by a champagne brunch!)
