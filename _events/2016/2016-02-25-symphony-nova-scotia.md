**Vivaldi's Four Seasons with Robert Uchida



The Four Seasons is Vivaldi's most famous creation, and one of the most beloved works from the entire Baroque period. Symphony Nova Scotia's former Concertmaster Robert Uchida, currently with the Edmonton Symphony, returns “home” to lead the orchestra on a musical journey through Vivaldi's glorious Spring, tempestuous Summer, meandering Autumn, and stormy, sparkling Winter. Plus: hear Baroque powerhouses from Purcell, Bach, and Pachelbel – including the iconic Canon, one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the world.
