The King's Chapel Choir is suspending its cycle of Bach masterworks for one year to present another great pillar of the Baroque repertoire – the Vespers of 1610 by Claudio Monteverdi. A monumental work scored for soloists, choir, and orchestra, the Vespers foreshadowed the religious masterworks of Bach and Handel, and has earned a place in the history of western music as a revolutionary and now iconic work.

Featuring the King's choristers alongside 15 instrumentalists on period instruments and a cast of early music soloists from across North America, these performances in two of Nova Scotia's architectural gems promise an outstanding musical and educational experience for students and audience members alike.
