His influential work as a performer, composer, recording artist, educator, and director of the Boxwood Festival & Workshop has played a significant role in reviving the flute in traditional Scottish and Canadian music. Joining Chris Norman are David Greenberg - baroque violin, Cape Breton fiddle; Alison McGillivray - baroque cello, viola da gamba; Magnus Holstrom – nyckelharpa; Yann Falquet - guitar, French Canadian & Acadian songs.
