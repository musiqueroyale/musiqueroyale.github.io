Blackwood is a duo that draws upon the wide ranging performance experience of composer/organist/pianist  Peter-Anthony Togni and bass clarinetist/composer Jeff Reilly. In Blackwood, the two of them explore the full range of their musical experience, from modality to modernism, in a sound that has the precision of gesture and clarity of focus that blurs any simple distinctions between improvisation and composition, and does so with a musicality and sensitivity that reminds us that such distinctions are moot. The glue that holds these two together is a common love of improvisation, a passion for taking musical risks, and a deep desire to connect with their audience.
