Peter-Anthony's music is spiritually rooted and contemplative, ranging from the ethereally quiet to the explosive outer limits of contemplation. One of Canada's busiest contemporary composers, Juno nominated Togni has toured internationally and his music is regularly broadcast worldwide. He is also a well-known Canadian broadcaster. Originally from Pembroke, Ontario, he currently resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he composes and teaches at Acadia and Dalhousie Universities.
