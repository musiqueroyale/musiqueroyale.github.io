Presented in Lunenburg by Musique Royale ‘A King's Christmas' features the University of King's College Chapel Choir directed by five-time Grammy award-winning musician Paul Halley with guest narrator, Roberta Barker, Associate Director of Theatre Arts at Dalhousie University.
 
A King's Christmas is a feast of seasonal song and story performed by the 24 choristers of the King's Chapel Choir in a tour of Nova Scotian communities each year, and this performance has become an annual tradition for many in Lunenburg. The music features carols from the mediaeval to the modern, and readings are selected to pair with the music, including poetry, excerpts from novels, short stories, and other literary works. Often, the music or readings include original material written for the occasion by Halley or the narrator.
