*Technical wizards & highly engaging*

Duo Fortin-Poirier, featuring pianists Amélie Fortin and Marie-Christine Poirier, has been heralded as one of the most promising piano duos of its generation. Both graduates of the Uni-versité de Montréal (Master and D.E.S.S.), these two artists naturally came together to form an extraordinarily powerful ensemble. Their complementing artistic intuition, explosive playing style and dynamic performances have been catching the attention of audiences and critics alike. In the past few years, Duo Fortin-Poirier has been touring with their concert programs Twenty Fingers and a Piano and Mémoires across Canada and USA. Also winner of many national and international prizes, Duo Fortin-Poirier is often heard on Ici Radio-Canada Première, Espace Musique and Radio Classique Montreal and Quebec. Duo Fortin-Poirier was selected by both Debut Atlantic and Prairie Debut to tour in the 2016-17 season. [www.duofortinpoirer.com](http://www.duofortinpoirer.com)
