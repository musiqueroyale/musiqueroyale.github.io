## West End Ladies ##

Award-winning international soprano, Rebecca Caine was born in Toronto and studied at the Guildhall School of Music, London. Rebecca recreates British leading ladies of London's West End musical theatre from the early Twentieth Century to the present day including Les Mis√©rables and Phantom of the Opera. Uniquely, her career has been divided between Opera and Musical Theatre, including her highly praised North American debut with the Canadian Opera Company in the title role of Lulu and her US cabaret debut at the Center on Halsted in Chicago. Rebecca gave the first performance at the new Telus recital hall at the Royal College of Music in Toronto and regularly tours Canada in recital with Robert Kortgaard.
