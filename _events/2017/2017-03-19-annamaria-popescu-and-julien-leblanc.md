## Mélodies de Venise ##

Ever since her sensational 1994 debut on short notice in Berlioz&#39;s Les Troyens with Sir Colin Davis and the London Symphony Orchestra, Canadian-born mezzo-soprano Annamaria Popescu has established herself as a force on opera stages around the world. Comfortable in both the mezzo and contralto idiom, she has been praised for her &quot;dark and velvety voice&quot; (Montréal Gazette), &quot;a svelte, penetrating contralto, by turns bubbly-urbane and stricken,&quot; according to The Financial Times. Following her success in London, she was soon invited to La Scala which now has become the anchorpoint of her career, appearing in 14 productions ever since with such conductors as Riccardo Muti, Vladimir Jurowski, Myung-Whun Chung and Carlo Rizzi.

Annamaria Popescu is Assistant Professor of Voice at McGill University. [annamariepopescu.com](http://annamariepopescu.com)
