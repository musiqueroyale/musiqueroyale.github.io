England&#39;s Hatfield College Chapel Choir is made up of approximately 24 singers who audition at the beginning of the academic year. Hatfield is known in particular for its social life as well as its high quality music-making. Whilst most of the singers are Hatfielders, many come from other colleges too. The choir currently rehearses on Sunday evenings and sings Choral Evensong every Monday in term-time, although numerous extra services are held throughout the year. In recent years the choir has sung at Hereford, Ripon and Chester cathedrals, as well as at Sherborne Abbey and York Minster, and sings in Durham Cathedral at least once a term. The choir tours every year; in 2016 the choir toured to Dusseldorf, and in 2017 the choir is heading to eastern Canada and the USA. Eight choral scholarships are available, as well as two organ scholarships. The choir is student-led, normally by a student from the college.

Jonathan Allsopp, Organ Scholar at Durham Cathedral, is the Director of Music at Hatfield College. [www.musicdurham.org](http://www.musicdurham.org/hatfield-chapel-choir)
