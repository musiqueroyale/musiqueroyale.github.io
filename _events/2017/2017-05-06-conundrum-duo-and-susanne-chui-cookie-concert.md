Conundrum Duo (Jack Chen, flute, and Ellen Gibling, harp) and Susanne Chui (dance)

Deep Sea Conundrum brings together dance and chamber music in a family-friendly performance exploring the mysterious and fascinating habitats of the ocean. A first-time collaboration between Susanne Chui and Conundrum duo, the show features a wide range of repertoire for flute and harp, along with lively choreography, and fun facts about the beautiful, bizarre, awe-inspiring, and fragile creatures of the deep. Suitable for ages 6 and up, Deep Sea Conundrum is engaging and informative for kids and adults alike!

Conundrum Duo is one of Nova Scotia&#39;s most versatile ensembles, performing classical, folk, and popular genres, but with a passion for Canadian new music! Building on the existing vast repertoire for the combination of flute and harp, the duo has expanded its horizons by collaborating with many artists. The duo has been featured in concert series in the Maritimes including Inner Space Concerts, The Music Room Chamber Players, Musikon Concert Society, Musical Meet and Greet, and Acadia Noon-Hour Concerts.
