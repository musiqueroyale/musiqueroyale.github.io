A concert of new works for choir and organ written and directed by five-time Grammy winning composer Paul Halley. These 14 pieces selected from Halley's extensive output of the last decade are all unfamiliar to Nova Scotian audiences. From wedding anthems written for his children to commissions for choirs across North America, these works set beautiful texts, including psalms, poems by Tennyson, Neruda, Herbert, Manley Hopkins, and Mechthild of Magdeburg â€“ in striking ways. 

Paul Halley is Director of Music at both the Chapel of the University of King's College and the Cathedral Church of All Saints, Halifax, NS. Paul is Creative Director and Co-Founder of Pelagos Music with his wife, Margaret Race. The winner of multiple Grammy Awards as principal composer and keyboardist for the Paul Winter Consort, Paul was Director of Music of The Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York, NY and then Founder and Director of the choirs, Chorus Angelicus and Gaudeamus, Torrington, CT. Paul relocated to Halifax, NS in 2007 to become Director of Chapel Music at the University of King's College.
