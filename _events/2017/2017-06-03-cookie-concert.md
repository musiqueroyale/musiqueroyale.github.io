The concert will showcase Nova Scotia's rich and diverse folk song heritage. Songs of love, sorrow, humour, and wit abound from the collection of famed folklorist Dr. Helen Creighton. Clary Croft will explore these songs from the Mi'kmaq, Acadian, Anglo, Celtic, German and African Nova Scotian repertoires. 

Clary Croft is a performer, author, folklore researcher, recording artist, and producer. The Encyclopaedia of Music in Canada has recognized Clary's contribution to Maritime folklore studies and his ongoing research into the traditional music of the Maritime Provinces. He is best known for his continuing work with the collection of his late mentor, Dr. Helen Creighton, the Nova Scotian-born, internationally renowned Canadian folklore pioneer. In addition to working with Dr. Creighton for the last fifteen years of her life, Clary was also responsible for cataloguing her collection at the Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management. The Halifax Mail Star calls him, “the acknowledged master of one of the richest repertoires in Canada.”
