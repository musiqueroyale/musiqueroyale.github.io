A thrilling and poignant cabaret show with soprano Suzanne Rigden, mezzo-soprano Kristin Hoff and pianist Sarah Russell. 

We Are Women! is a show where three women bring us on a musical journey of the female experience through excerpts from the musical theatre repertoire of the past century. Their relationships as sisters, parents, children, friends and lovers carry us through questions and stories about love, marriage, envy, loss, passion for life, and womens' desire for independence and recognition.
