Capella Regalis Men and Boys Choir was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, by Director Nick Halley in 2010\. The choir comprises ten men and twelve boys (ages 7â€“14) and is modeled on the great Anglican tradition of men and boys church choirs. While Canada was once rich with such choirs, Capella Regalis is one of only a handful of men and boys choirs in Canada today.

Capella Regalis is a registered Society under the Societies Act of Nova Scotia and is an educational programme of Musique Royale.
