Musique Royale celebrates Canada Day in Lunenburg with a powerful performance of Scott Macmillan's Celtic Mass For the Sea. The Celtic Mass is now approaching the thirtieth year since it was written and had been performed numerous times, nationally and internationally in its history. This will be the first performance on the south shore and the only presentation in the province at this time. The 40 voice choir has been assembled from local choristers and those who have sung the mass in previous years. Scott Macmillan conducts the performance which also includes a wonderful Celtic instrumental ensemble featuring the Blue Engine String Quartet plus Bass - Max Kasper; Harp - Karen Rokos; Guitar - Brian Doyle; Pipes/flute - Glenn Coolen; Fiddle - Colin Grant; Mandolin -Louis Benoit; Piano - Sharon Gow Knickle.

Commissioned by the CBC in 1988, the 'Celtic Mass for the Sea' has become a contemporary choral classic. It has been performed numerous times since then in Canada, the US and Europe, capturing a cheering standing ovation at Carnegie Hall in New York in 2002 and enthusiastically received by audiences in the UK and Germany. This mass is a unique celebration of the sea's majesty, ferocity and vitality, with words and music based on Celtic themes. Composed by Scott Macmillan, with libretto by Jennyfer Brickenden, it is a powerfully imagined work for chorus, strings, and Celtic instrumental quintet.

Musique Royale is pleased to present this event in collaboration with weekend Canada Day celebrations in Lunenburg, the Lunenburg Academy of Music and support from the Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage 150 Forward Fund.
