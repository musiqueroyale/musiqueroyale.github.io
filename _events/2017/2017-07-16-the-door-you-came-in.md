Drawn from stories in _The Danger Tree_ by David Macfarlane and performed by the writer with award-winning composer Douglas Cameron, this unique blend of spoken word and music tells the funny and moving story of a Newfoundland family and the war that changed it forever.

About _The Door You Came In_. A writer visits his dying mother. He brings a book that he'd written twenty-five years ago to read to her. It's about her family. But it's also about the terrible battle – Beaumont Hamel – that sits at the heart of both Newfoundland's and her family's history. So begins _The Door You Came In_ -- a two-man performance based on David Macfarlane's acclaimed memoir, 'The Danger Tree'. The songs and the music of _The Door You Came_ In are Douglas Cameron's department. A seasoned, Genie-nominated singer and performer, Cameron plays banjola, mandolin, ukulele, and harmonica. His engaging, foot-tapping performance combines popular tunes of the day ("Pack Up Your Troubles," and "If You Were the Only Girl in the World") with original compositions. Macfarlane's narrative weaves seamlessly throughout the music. _The Door You Came In_ isn't quite a play and it isn't quite a concert. It's a musical story – sometimes funny, sometimes tragic – that tells the tales of family, and memory, and war.
