For more than fifty years, NYO Canada has enjoyed an iconic reputation as Canada's orchestral finishing school, providing the most comprehensive and in-depth training program available to our country's best young classical musicians. The orchestra, as part of Canada's 150, plans an extensive cross Canada tour in summer 2017\. While in Halifax, an ensemble of young musicians will travel to the south shore for a performance at Cecilia's Retreat in Mahone Bay.
