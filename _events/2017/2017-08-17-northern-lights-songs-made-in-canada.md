Canada has a lot to celebrate in song. Fabulous musicians through the decades have helped to define for us all what it means to grow up in this vast, varied and beautiful land we call home. Ever aware of this rich landscape of musical possibilities, Patricia O'Callaghan continues to build a repertoire of songs that speak to her heart and must be sung. From the classics of Leonard Cohen and Robert Charlebois, historic Canadiana and hits of contemporary pop sensations like Matthew Barber and Sarah Harmer.... to such revered artists as Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot.... plus some delightful surprises!

Nostalgia, toe tapping, and a twist on great tunes from our past.... we celebrate Canada's long tradition of great music making.
