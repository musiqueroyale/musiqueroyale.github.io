Celebrate Musique Royale's 32nd summer festival season! Come and enjoy great gospel music led by Janelle Lucyk and guest musicians from King's College Chapel Choir and Capella Regalis. Music begins on the hour and half hour with breaks to view our auction tables, sample the menu and mingle with friends. Savour a variety of tasty items and visit our auction tables where we have gathered a number of useful (paint, dishes, gift certificates) to unique treasures (tapestry, stained glass, unusual mirrors).
