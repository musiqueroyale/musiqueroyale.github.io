Helios Vocal Ensemble is Atlantic Canada's premier vocal ensemble, performing sacred and secular music, specializing in Renaissance polyphony, a fluid and unifying musical language defining its time. Their "Madrigal Mystery Tour" concert offers rapturous, rambunctious and raunchy songs from across Europe, with a cappella works by some of the finest composers of the 16th and 17th centuries.

The five members of the vocal group all have affiliation with the choir at St. George's Round Church in Halifax and its director Garth MacPhee.
