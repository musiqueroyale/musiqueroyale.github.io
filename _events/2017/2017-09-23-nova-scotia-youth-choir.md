The Nova Scotia Youth Choir is a program on the Nova Scotia Choral Federation. Through auditions, approximately 40 of the province's most talented young choral singers ages 16-25 are chosen each year to work with a faculty of fine musicians dedicated to excellence in vocal performance and musicianship. These young musicians are provided a challenging opportunity to work, develop and perform choral music together at a very high calibre. Choristers work with the faculty during two rehearsal periods in May and August.
