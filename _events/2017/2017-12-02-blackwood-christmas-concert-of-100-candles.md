Join us as we delve into the positive power of Christmas â€“ in an atmosphere of depth, reflection, lyricism and the celebration of intense beauty. Music that boldly shifts down into the heart of space, openness, and contemplation and for a little over an hour, gives you a chance to go slow in a fast time.
