With its five unique voices Fifth Wind will lead an exploration into the fascinating world of wind quintets. The program will include music from three centuries and will end with a brand new work written just for Fifth Wind in January of this year. Come and join in the Beethoven Jump, hear a cat and mouse tale, and experience five wind instruments combined in countless ways to create a rainbow of sounds and textures that can't be found anywhere else!
