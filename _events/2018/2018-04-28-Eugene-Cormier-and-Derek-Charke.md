Eugene Cormier is in high demand as a solo performer, chamber musician, accompanist, studio musician, adjudicator, and as a teacher. He has won top honours at The Newfoundland Music Festival, The Nova Scotia Music Festival, The Newfoundland Arts and Letters Competition and has been awarded grants from The Newfoundland & Labrador Arts Council and Acadia University. Derek Charke is a JUNO and three-time ECMA award-winning composer and flutist. His music is eclectic, often defying categorization due to wide-ranging influences. Described as minimalist and post-minimal, modernist, inventive, rich textured, full of colour, and imbued with drama and rhythmic vitality, his music often incorporates tonality and modality, electronics and soundscapes, explorations of contemporary instrumental techniques, and improvisation.
