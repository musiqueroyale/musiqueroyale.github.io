Musique Royale invites you to St. John’s Lunenburg where Capella Regalis Men and Boys choir will perform a special Evensong service on May 20th. Capella Regalis was founded in Halifax by director Nick Halley in 2010 and is modeled on the centuries-old European tradition of men and boys church choirs. While Canada was once rich with such choirs, Capella Regalis is one of only a handful in Canada today. The choir is a free program open to any boy age 6-12 who passes an audition. It is a Nova Scotia non-profit society and an educational outreach program of Musique Royale. The choir is ‘in residence’ in both the University of King’s College Chapel, and the Cathedral Church of All Saints in Halifax, singing Evensongs regularly in the Cathedral as part of the “Sundays at Four” series and rehearsing in the King’s College Chapel. Musique Royale is thrilled to present Capella Regalis as they present a special Evensong on the South Shore.  The Evensong will include Responses of Wm. Smith, Purcell’s Evening service in G minor, and for the anthem: Attwood’s Come, Holy Ghost!
