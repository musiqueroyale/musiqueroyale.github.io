British cellist Michael Kevin Jones has found a unique place for himself among today's performers. While a student at the Royal College of Music in London he was chosen to play for the Royal family and awarded a German government scholarship for further study in Koln where he quickly became solo cellist and toured the world with top musical groups. He has developed a non conventional career incorporating multi-musical activities and he is also an avid teacher and coach. As member of 'the Jones Maruri cello guitar duo ' he had his first top 10 selling CD 'Original music for cello and guitar' in Hong Kong and China and as a soloist his recording of the complete Bach suites on a 1667 Stradivarius cello for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has received international critical acclaim and several audio awards. Projects for 2018 and 2019 include solo tours of South Africa, Canada and Europe.
