Ralsg책rd & Tullberg use wooden transverse flutes, an instrument that was an integral part of the southern Swedish folk music scene in the 19th and 20th centuries. Similar instruments are still widely used in Ireland, France and England. Ties are being made to the musical worlds of these countries and Swedish flute music is undergoing a revival. Come to Cecilia's Retreat and hear Ralsg책rd & Tullberg breathing new life into the Swedish wooden flute tradition!
