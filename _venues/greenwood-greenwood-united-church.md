Greenwood United Church has a history dating back to 1841 when Knox Presbyterian church was established on Baddeck Bay. Later, the congregation moved into the heart of Baddeck itself, and built our current church building. Greenwood has changed a lot from those early years, but we are still committed to being a sign of God's presence to the people of Baddeck. We host many activities throughout the year including concerts, clothing sales, outreach to shut-ins, ecumenical and community events. You would be very welcome to join us for worship any Sunday or at any of our community events.
