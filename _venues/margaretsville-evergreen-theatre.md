Margaretsville is a picturesque fishing village with magnificent sunsets and a panoramic view of the Bay of Fundy. It is the home of Fundy Folk, a society devoted to the performing arts that began as an extension of the kitchen parties that were common among the folk type musicians of the area. The Evergreen Theatre, located at 1660 Stronach Mountain Rd. in Margaretsville, is a simple symmetrical wooden structure with gothic windows. The building is 175 years old, originally the Evergreen Baptist Church. In recent years it was donated to the community and converted into a performance space, now hosting over 20 performances per year. Its marvelous acoustics make it ideal as a venue for music performances.
