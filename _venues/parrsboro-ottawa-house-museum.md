Parrsboro is admired for its elegant houses and estates, many of which were built during the 1800's, and the breathtaking scenic view it affords of the extraordinary tides of the Minas Basin.
Construction of Ottawa House by the Sea was begun in the 1770's on the site of an Acadian trading fort. Overlooking the rocky cliffs of nearby Partridge Island, historic Ottawa House
served as the summer home of Sir Charles Tupper, former Prime Minister of Canada and Father of Canadian Confederation. After serving as an inn for more than a century, this lovely Georgian structure was converted to a museum filled with period furnishings. Several rooms also house exhibits showcasing Parrsboro's shipbuilding heritage. The museum is situated at 1155 Whitehall Road.
