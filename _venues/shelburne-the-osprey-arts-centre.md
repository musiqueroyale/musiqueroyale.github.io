The Osprey Arts Centre vision sees a community where all members, youth, adult and senior, and culturally diverse, have access to high quality performing arts events, both amateur and professional, to be a place where people turn for training in the arts and to be available to all members of the community as a place to perform. Open year round, the Osprey exhibits visual art and presents popular and classical music, live theatre, summer arts camps for kids, a literary festival, and book launches. It hosts events across Shelburne County in schools and other venues and rents its space to community groups and for public and private functions such as weddings, meetings, conferences, and lectures. The Centre is run by a volunteer Board of Directors and three part-time staff.
