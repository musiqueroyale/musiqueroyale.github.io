Wedgeport is a picturesque Acadian village overlooking the Tusket River in Yarmouth County. Eglise St- Michel, a large structure seating 700 people was built in 1867. In 1906 it was considered ‘too small' and an addition was made of two large towers placed on either side of the main building. Renovations and upkeep through the years have made the church the pride of parishioners – a magnificent structure seating 1000 people.
