Wolfville is a town of elegance and charm set amid natural wonders. Stately elms, manicured lawns, and the rich architecture of its century old homes gives Wolfville an historic grace and unprecedented charm. Home of Acadia University, one of Canada's finest undergraduate schools, Wolfville is considered the academic and cultural centre of the Annapolis Valley. The university had no chapel until 1960, when major funds were provided by the Fred C. Manning Charitable Fund. The Manning Memorial Chapel, an American Colonial brick structure was opened in October of 1963. Of particular note is the classical Baroque organ in the balcony and the spectacular front stained glass windows with their images outlined in gold leaf.
