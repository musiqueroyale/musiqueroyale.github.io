                    comic opera ‘Don Pasquale' the following week in Lunenburg, Maritime
                    Concert Opera's Artistic Director Nina Scott Stoddart will introduce us
                    to the world of ‘comic opera', or ‘opera buffa'. The opera itself is
                    highly entertaining and is generally regarded as being the high point of
                    the 19th century opera buffa tradition. Nina will share her considerable
                    knowledge and good humour on the subject with us. A tasty brunch,
                    including Adams & Knickle scallops, follows Nina's presentation.

                    Nature, Missa Gaia combines the usual texts and creeds of liturgy with
                    more unusual texts and live recordings of nature's awesome creatures. The
                    immense sounds of humpback whales and the eerie calls of wolves are woven
                    with contemporary jazz in the instrumental, choral, and solo vocal parts
                    to create a mass of stunning energy and depth. The musical event of the
