The choir sings for the Chapel’s weekly services of Evensong and Eucharist and gives concerts throughout Eastern Canada and the United States. This is the final concert of the second annual three-part concert series at the Cathedral Church of All Saints entitled “King’s At The Cathedral.” Next season, the choir will be performing the Rachmaninov Vespers on 6 November 2011, A King’s Christmas, 9-11 December 2011, and Bach’s B Minor Mass, 20 and 22 April 2012.The Chapel Choir of the University of King’s College, modeled on the Chapel Choirs of Cambridge and Oxford, comprises twenty choristers selected through annual auditions held in September, which are open to all students at King’s College and Dalhousie University. The choir’s primary function is to sing at the weekly Evensongs and Eucharists, as well as other major services throughout the academic year. The choir had its beginnings in the early 1970s when Dr. Robert Crouse put together a group of singers to lead the worship at the Thursday Eucharists at King’s. Since that time the choir has expanded its role, having sung under the direction of several notable conductors including Helen Roby, David Buley, and most recently Dr. Walter Kemp.</p> <p>In July 2007, Paul Halley was appointed Director of Music of the Chapel and since then has built the group into a fine ensemble which now includes touring and recording amongst its activities. Halley says of the choir: “It is my hope that over time, prospective students will view the Chapel Choir as one of the reasons to attend university in Halifax. There’s really nothing quite like the training a fine collegiate chapel choir can offer. You get through so much first-rate music, just in one week - all the anthems, motets, mass settings, canticles, psalms and hymns - that your musical literacy increases at a phenomenal rate.”</p> </p> <div class="small"> <div class="social-media"> <b>FOLLOW</b> <a href="http://www.kingschapel.ca" target='_blank'>Website</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="entry"> <div class="row"> <div class="span12"> <img class="centered" src="/assets/artists/la-tour-baroque.jpg"> <h2>La Tour Baroque</h2> <p><p>Based in the province of New Brunswick on the east coast of Canada, the La Tour Baroque Duo has received accolades such as “exquisitely played” and “spellbinding” from critics and audiences alike.

In addition to being a musician, Colin has also worked for over 20 years as a dancer, actor, stuntman, singer, choreographer, acrobat and martial-artist. This combination of high level music and theatre is quite unique and he continues to find new, exciting and ground breaking ways to combine his two passions.

The albums feature the oboe and Colin’s multi-instrumentalism and are comprised of original Canadian commissions, Canadian arrangements, Canadian/World premieres and virtuosic showpieces that span many musical genres.</p> <p>As an oboist he has played with groups such as; The Calgary very diverse Philharmonic, National Ballet, Symphony of the Kootenays, Soundstreams, Toronto Concert Orchestra, Scarborough Philharmonic, Niagara International Chamber Music Festival, The Jive Mommas, High Strung, The Fabulous Doo-Wop Boy and The Plaid Tongued Devils.

Originally from Aylmer Ontario, she came to Toronto in 2000 to study cello with Simon Fryer and piano with Peter Longworth at The Glenn Gould School. Since completing the Performance Diploma Program, Lydia has enjoyed many of the diverse musical opportunities this city has to offer. Some of those include playing for music theatre companies Stage West and Theatre Aquarius, the new music ensemble Array, electric violinist Dr. Draw, and chamber folk group Ozere. She has premiered solo cello and chamber music works by a number of Toronto and Austrian composers and gives recitals regularly, some of which have been recorded by CBC and CIUT radio.

She performed in Australia, Korea and Chicago at the ages of ten, twelve and fourteen and completed her ARCT (Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Toronto) in performance for both piano and cello before attending her post secondary studies. The year after she finished high school she also traveled to Europe for five months. While there she spent one term at l’Abri, an International Christian Study and Philosophy Centre, and backpacked across Europe for two months with her cello. While in Switzerland, she also met her husband, Marty. Since January of 2014, Lydia has toured the continent with Quartetto Gelato, an experience for which she is extremely grateful. After all, her daughter Arya, who often joins them on tour, is their biggest fan!</p> <h2 id="peter-de-sotto">Peter De Sotto</h2> <p>Peter is a remarkable talent who’s chameleon like abilities allow him to perform on the violin not only as a seasoned classical violinist but also as a dazzling gypsy virtuoso. If that is not enough the real surprise is his fabulous tenor voice, which ranges from South America, to authentic Irish folk, to the great romantic Italian songs and arias including Turandots “Nessun Dorma”. DeSotto has been referred to as “a credible Pavarotti stand-in (Stereo Review). Peter has appeared in leading roles in numerous opera and theatre productions and was a member of The Toronto Symphony Orchestra for 11 years, and was voted Musician Of The Year in 1999 by the Toronto Musicians Association.</p> <p>“Whenever Peter De Sotto (tenor, violin, mandolin) released his natural, Italianate tenor – usually in Sicilian and Neapolitan folk Songs – I found tears springing to my eyes. It hardly seems fair that he’s also a violin wiz who tossed off a gypsy number at dizzying speed.” (National Post)</p> <p>Not only is Peter “an amazing violinist capable of playing any style of music convincingly” but he has “one of the most gorgeous voices I have ever heard. I couldn’t believe any one person could possess that much talent.” (Glenn Dicterow, concert master, New York Philharmonic)</p> <h2 id="alexander-sevastian">Alexander Sevastian</h2> <p>Alexander Sevastian joined Quartetto Gelato in 2002.
