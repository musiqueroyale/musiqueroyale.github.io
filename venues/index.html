The first service of worship was under the Methodists and was held on July 3rd, 1782 by the Rev. William Black. The first Methodist church building was dedicated at the comer of St. Anthony and Church Streets in 1789. The second Methodist church building was dedicated in 1846 near the site of the old Mohawk Fort. It was later moved to where the manse now stands. It was eventually taken down and the present brick church was built.</p> <p>The Presbyterian church which was called St. Andrew’s was built in 1862 and is now owned by the Arts Council and is just across the street from the manse. In 1919, St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church and St. George’s Methodist Church United, a forerunner of the later union which came in 1925. It is thought to be the first union of the two churches, at least in the Maritimes.</p> <div class="small"> <p> <b>Location:</b> 393 St. George Street, Annapolis Royal, NS, B0S 1A0 </p> <p><b>Contact:</b> John Montgomerie </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="entry"> <div class="row"> <div class="span12"> <img class="centered" src="/assets/venues/blue-rocks-st-barnabas-anglican-church.jpg"> <h4>Blue Rocks</h4> <h2>St. Barnabas Anglican Church</h2> <p>St. Barnabas’ Anglican Church is a Greek Revival styled building, built in 1886, located in the heart of the small fishing village of Blue Rocks.

Following its completion, the congregation continued to expand and in 1907 two wings were added to the church; one on the nave and one on the chancel making it considerably larger. The additions were constructed by noted local builders Boehner &amp; Sons of nearby West LaHave. The expansion of the church ensured it could continue to meet the needs of its congregation and was viewed as more palatable alternative to constructing a new church.

Stately elms, manicured lawns, and the rich architecture of its century old homes gives Wolfville an historic grace and unprecedented charm. Home of Acadia University, one of Canada’s finest undergraduate schools, Wolfville is considered the academic and cultural centre of the Annapolis Valley. The university had no chapel until 1960, when major funds were provided by the Fred C. Manning Charitable Fund. The Manning Memorial Chapel, an American Colonial brick structure was opened in October of 1963. Of particular note is the classical Baroque organ in the balcony and the spectacular front stained glass windows with their images outlined in gold leaf.</p> <div class="small"> <p> <b>Location:</b> 45 Acadia St., Wolfville </p> <p><b>Contact:</b> <a href="mailto:burbidsn@xcountry.tv">Nancy Burbidge</a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="content"> <div class="row"> <div class="span6 right"> <ul> <li><a href="/sponsors/">Sponsors</a></li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/musique.royale">Facebook</a></li> <li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/MusiqueRoyale">Twitter</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="span6 left"> <span>© Musique Royale 2018</span> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script> </html>
