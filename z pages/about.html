		    <p>Musique Royale is a not-for-profit organization based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, dedicated to promoting traditional and early music in historic venues throughout the province. Since its founding in 1985, Musique Royale has continued to celebrate venues of architectural and historic significance, and bring world-class music to communities across the province.</p>
		    <p>Founded in 1985 by John Grew and a small group of dedicated friends, the French and English overtones in the festival's name were chosen specifically to refer to the presence of more than one cultural force in Nova Scotia's development, and to pay tribute to the province's diverse musical heritage. Current Artistic and Managing Director, Barbara Butler, continues to guide the organization in its original mandate, while promoting its growth from a summer festival to include a year-round concert series on the south shore.</p>
		    <p>One of our main successes is working with volunteers throughout the province in venues of all sizes and histories as well as to promote a sense of community and shared pride in Nova Scotia's rich heritage. It is as much about bringing great traditional and early music to local communities as it is about offering the visiting musicians a taste of Nova Scotia, its landscape, its people, and its historic venues.</p>
		    <p>Volunteers are at the heart of each event, warmly welcoming local, national, and international musicians and audience members alike to the 20 plus communities partnered with Musique Royale. Our work would not be possible without the generous support of each local community. We gratefully thank them, and all our patrons and sponsors, named and unnamed. Musique Royale is generously supported by Federal Department of Canadian Heritage, the Nova Scotia Department of Communities, Culture and Heritage, Arts Nova Scotia, the Lloyd Carr Harris Foundation, Music Nova Scotia, season benefactor Peggy Corkum and valued anonymous support.</p>
		    <p>Whether you are a local resident in a seaside community on the South Shore, or a visiting traveller in the magnificent highlands of Cape Breton, Musique Royale has a concert for you!</p>
